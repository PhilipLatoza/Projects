//   Import UIKit which is apple's Software Development Kit. Contains functions that can be used for the User Interface. Created new view controller for About the Game. ViewDidLoad() loads the view and layers of buttons, labels and images when this specific view is selected. Added htmlPath which adds a webView with game instructions written in HTML.


//    Added special function to connect with the label on the storyboard. When the button is selected, it runs an animation and closes this About view and returns to the previous About the Main View where you are able to play the game.
